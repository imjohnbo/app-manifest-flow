### Why App Manifest Flow?

- You're a GitHub App developer, and you want to support customers using GitHub Enterprise Server. And the ["Creating a GitHub App" flow](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app/) seems cumbersome.
- Additional reasons from the [docs](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/creating-github-apps-from-a-manifest/):
    - Help new team members come up-to-speed quickly when developing GitHub Apps.
    - Allow others to extend a GitHub App using the GitHub APIs without requiring them to configure an app.
    - Create GitHub App reference designs to share with the GitHub community.
    - Ensure you deploy GitHub Apps to development and production environments using the same configuration.
    - Track revisions to a GitHub App configuration.
